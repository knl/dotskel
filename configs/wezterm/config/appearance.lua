---// BACKGROUND //-----------------------------------------------------------------

---The `background` config option allows you to compose a number of layers to produce
---the background content in the terminal.
---
---Layers can be image files, gradients or solid blocks of color. Layers composite
---over each other based on their alpha channel. Images in layers can be made to fill
---the viewport or to tile, and also to scroll with optional parallax as the viewport
---is scrolled.
---
---The background option is a table that lists the desired layers starting with the
---deepest/back-most layer. Subsequent layers are composited over the top of preceding
---layers.
---
---**Layer Definition**
---A layer is a lua table with the following fields:
---
---* `source` - defines the source of the layer texture data. See below for source
---  definitions
---* `attachment` - controls whether the layer is fixed to the viewport or moves as
---   it scrolls. Can be:
---   * `"Fixed"` (the default) to not move as the window scrolls,
---   * `"Scroll"` to scroll 1:1 with the number of pixels scrolled in the viewport,
---   * `{Parallax=0.1}` to scroll 1:10 with the number of pixels scrolled in the viewport.
---* `repeat_x` - controls whether the image is repeated in the x-direction. Can be one of:
---   * `"Repeat"` - Repeat as much as possible to cover the area. The last image will
---     be clipped if it doesn't fit. This is the default.
---   * `"Mirror"` - Like `"Repeat"` except that the image is alternately mirrored
---     which can make images that don't tile seamlessly look a bit better when repeated
---   * `"NoRepeat"` - the image is not repeated.
---* `repeat_x_size` - Normally, when repeating, the image is tiled based on its
---  width such that each copy of the image is immediately adjacent to the preceding
---  instance. You may set `repeat_x_size` to a different value to increase or
---  decrease the space between the repeated instances. Accepts:
---  - number values in pixels,
---  - string values like `"100%"` to specify a size relative to the viewport,
---* `"10cell"` to specify a size based on the terminal cell metrics.
---* `repeat_y` - like `repeat_x` but affects the y-direction.
---* `repeat_y_size` - like `repeat_x_size` but affects the y-direction.
---* `vertical_align` - controls the initial vertical position of the layer, relative
---   to the viewport:
---  * `"Top"` (the default),
---  * `"Middle"`,
---  * `"Bottom"`
---* `vertical_offset` - specify an offset from the initial vertical position. Accepts:
---  * number values in pixels,
---  * string values like `"100%"` to specify a size relative to the viewport,
---  * `"10cell"` to specify a size based on terminal cell metrics.
---* `horizontal_align` - controls the initial horizontal position of the layer, relative
---  to the viewport:
---  * `"Left"` (the default),
---  * `"Center"`
---  * `"Right"`
---* `horizontal_offset` - like `vertical_offset` but applies to the x-direction.
---* `opacity` - a number in the range `0` through `1.0` inclusive that is multiplied
---  with the alpha channel of the source to adjust the opacity of the layer. The default
---  is `1.0` to use the source alpha channel as-is. Using a smaller value makes the
---  layer less opaque/more transparent.
---* `hsb` - a hue, saturation, brightness transformation that can be used to adjust
---  those attributes of the layer. See foreground_text_hsb for more information about
---  this kind of transform.
---* `height` - controls the height of the image. The following values are accepted:
---  * `"Cover"` (this is the default) - Scales the image, preserving aspect ratio,
---    to the smallest possible size to fill the viewport, leaving no empty space.
---    If the aspect ratio of the viewport differs from the image, the image is cropped.
---  * `"Contain"` - Scales the image as large as possible without cropping or stretching.
---    If the viewport is larger than the image, tiles the image unless `repeat_y` is
---    set to `"NoRepeat"`.
---  * `123` - specifies a height of `123` pixels
---  * `"50%"` - specifies a size of `50%` of the viewport height
---  * `"2cell"` - specifies a size equivalent to `2` rows
---* `width` - controls the width of the image. Same details as `height` but applies to the x-direction.

---
---If escape sequences are used to change the cursor color, they will take precedence

---// INACTIVE PANES //-------------------------------------------------------------

---To make it easier to see which pane is active, the inactive panes are dimmed and
---de-saturated slightly.
---
---You can specify your own transformation to the pane colors with a hue, saturation,
---brightness (HSB) multiplier.
---
---In this example, inactive panes will be slightly de-saturated and dimmed; this is
---the default configuration:
---
---```lua
---config.inactive_pane_hsb = {
---  saturation = 0.9,
---  brightness = 0.8,
---}
---```
---
---The transform works by converting the RGB colors to HSV values and then multiplying
---the HSV by the numbers specified in `inactive_pane_hsb`.
---
---Modifying the hue changes the hue of the color by rotating it through the color
---wheel. It is not as useful as the other components, but is available "for free"
---as part of the colorspace conversion.
---
---Modifying the saturation can add or reduce the amount of "colorfulness". Making the
---value smaller can make it appear more washed out.
---
---Modifying the brightness can be used to dim or increase the perceived amount of light.
---
---The range of these values is 0.0 and up; they are used to multiply the existing
---values, so the default of 1.0 preserves the existing component, whilst 0.5 will
---reduce it by half, and 2.0 will double the value.
config.inactive_pane_hsb = {
  saturation = 0.6,
  brightness = 0.45,
}

---This setting controls the maximum frame rate used when rendering easing effects
---for blinking cursors, blinking text and visual bell.
---
---Setting it larger will result in smoother easing effects but will increase GPU
---utilization.
---
---If you are running with a CPU renderer (eg: you have front\_end = `"Software"`, or
---your system doesn't have a GPU), then setting `animation_fps = 1` is recommended,
---as doing so will disable easing effects and use transitions:
---
---```lua
---config.animation_fps = 1
---config.cursor_blink_ease_in = 'Constant'
---config.cursor_blink_ease_out = 'Constant'
---```
config.animation_fps = 60

---Limits the maximum number of frames per second that wezterm will attempt to draw.
---
---Defaults to `60`.

---// HYPERLINK RULES //------------------------------------------------------------

---Defines rules to match text from the terminal output and generate clickable links.
--
---The value is a list of rule entries. Each entry has the following fields:
---* `regex` - the regular expression to match (see supported Regex syntax)
---* `format` - Controls which parts of the regex match will be used to form the link.
---  Must have a `prefix:` signaling the protocol type (e.g., `https:`/`mailto:`), which
---  can either come from the regex match or needs to be explicitly added. The format
---  string can use placeholders like `$0`, `$1`, `$2` etc. that will be replaced with
---  that numbered capture group. So, `$0` will take the entire region of text matched
---  by the whole regex, while `$1` matches out the first capture group. In the example
---  below, `mailto:$0` is used to prefix a protocol to the text to make it into an URL.
---
---_Since: Version 20230320-124340-559cb7b0_
---* `highlight` - specifies the range of the matched text that should be
---  highlighted/underlined when the mouse hovers over the link. The value is a number
---  that corresponds to a capture group in the regex. The default is `0`,
---  highlighting the entire region of text matched by the regex. `1` would be the
---  first capture group, and so on.
---
---_Since: Version 20230408-112425-69ae8472_
---The regex syntax now supports backreferences and look around assertions. See Fancy
---Regex Syntax for the extended syntax, which builds atop the underlying Regex syntax.
---In prior versions, only the base Regex syntax was supported.

---Assigning `hyperlink_rules` overrides the built-in default rules.
